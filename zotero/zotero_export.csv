"XADFKIH2","journalArticle","","Amihud, Yakov; Goyenko, Ruslan","Mutual Fund’s R2 as Predictor of Performance","","","","","","We propose that fund performance can be predicted by its R2, obtained from a regression of its returns on a multi-factor benchmark model. Lower R2 indicates greater selectivity and it significantly predicts better performance. Stock funds sorted into lowest-quintile lagged R2 and highest-quintile lagged alpha produce significant annual alpha of 3.8%. Across funds, R2 is positively associated with fund size and negatively associated with its expenses and manager’s tenure.","","2026-01-27 04:15:53","2026-01-27 04:15:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/pushpaghimire/Zotero/storage/J8IKZNS4/Amihud and Goyenko - Mutual Fund’s R2 as Predictor of Performance.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"83HP8Q9K","journalArticle","","Arnott, Rob; Harvey, Campbell R; Kalesnik, Vitali; Linnainmaa, Juhani","Alice’s Adventures in Factorland: Three Blunders That Plague Factor Investing","","","","","","Factor investing has failed to live up to its many promises. Its success is compromised by three problems that are often underappreciated by investors. First, many investors develop exaggerated expectations about factor performance as a result of data mining, crowding, unrealistic trading cost expectations, and other concerns. Second, for investors using naive risk management tools, factor returns can experience downside shocks far larger than would be expected. Finally, investors are often led to believe their factor portfolio is diversified. Diversification can vanish, however, in certain economic conditions, when factor returns become much more correlated. Factor investing is a powerful tool, but understanding the risks involved is essential before adopting this investment framework.","","2026-01-27 04:15:58","2026-01-27 04:15:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/pushpaghimire/Zotero/storage/TL9FWX2V/Arnott et al. - Alice’s Adventures in Factorland Three Blunders That Plague Factor Investing.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
